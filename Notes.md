order of business: 

1. Copy paste the components from the planmyplate repo
2. settle the update feature, spit the server.js
3. settle the UI to how you want it, in app style 
4. remove the supabase linking part, and use local storage instead. 
5. add any other features or upgrades to the UI, and functionality. (eg fridge filter to shopping list, fridge shelves,  )
6. find a way to make it into an .apk file that i can download onto my phone, while keeping all the functionality intact 
(can use capacitor to package the app into an .apk)
